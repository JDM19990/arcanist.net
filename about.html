  <h1>What is the Arcanist?</h1>
    <p><strong>The Arcanist: Fantasy Publishing, LLC</strong> is a small, independent press based in Bloomington, Indiana, dedicated to exceptional Fantasy fiction. We publish books and periodicals that showcase diverse voices and imaginative worlds, drawing from authors of all backgrounds.</p>
    <p>Our stories go beyond traditional quests and gratuitous battles. We aim to illuminate the human condition through the lens of whimsical worlds. Some of our heroes are larger than life; others are ordinary people pushed beyond the edge of possibility. In every tale, we explore what it means to endure, transform, and rise in the face of the impossible.</p>
  <hr class="short">
  <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p><strong>The Arcanist</strong> began as a tabletop role-playing game publisher called <em>The Arcanist’s Refuge</em>, founded by James D. Mills in 2019. Under that banner, we released several bestselling supplements and adventures on <a href="https://www.dmsguild.com/browse.php?author=J.D.%20Mills">DMsGuild.com</a> earning critical acclaim and collaborating with industry names like Grim Press, Gnome Made Games, and MrRhexx.</p>
    <p>In 2022, <em>The Arcanist’s Refuge</em> closed following a personal loss in James’s family. During this time, James returned to school at Southern New Hampshire University, where he earned his BA in Creative Writing and Psychology—and discovered a passion for contemporary literary fiction.</p>
    <p>It was at SNHU that James met Lee Patton. Together, they founded <a href="https://magazine.thearcanist.net"><em>The Literary Fantasy Magazine</em></a> in 2024, publishing under the new imprint <strong>The Arcanist: Fantasy Publishing</strong>. Following the successful launch of the magazine’s first issue in January 2025, we expanded into book publishing—partnering with emerging authors to develop rich, character-driven Fantasy stories we felt were missing from the traditional publishing landscape.</p>
    <p>Our debut novel, <a href="https://thearcanist.net/books/avos"><em>A Valley of Shadow</em></a> by Lee Patton, will release on October 31, 2025.</p>

  <hr class="short">
  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p><strong>The Arcanist stands for freedom in genuine storytelling.</strong> Through our novels and periodicals, we cultivate a vibrant, inclusive community of authors from all walks of life. For us, narrative comes first—always.</p>
    <p>In a world fractured by politics, war, and inequality, we aim to serve our readers and writers with authentic, soul-driven art. We embrace complexity, welcome paradox, and amplify voices from around the globe—regardless of identity, background, or borders.</p>
    <p>As a publisher, we offer some of the highest royalty rates in the industry. We treat every book as if it were our own. Unlike many traditional publishers, we put people first—our authors, our readers, and the wider literary community. We believe in breaking down barriers to fantastic fiction, and building a home for stories that matter.</p>  <hr>

          <h2>Menke HB — Associate Editor</h2>
            <p>Menke HB was born in The Netherlands, yet English became her heart language before she moved to the USA in her early 20s. Struggling to feel like she belonged anywhere, she wrote for herself through a decade of chronic depression.</p>
            <p>As an English Language and Literature major, her focus on poetry and African American Literature emboldened her to speak up and start sharing her writing. Inspired by authors like Langston Hughes and Octavia E. Butler, Menke writes both LGBTQIA+ and cishet speculative fiction, allowing her characters to figure out who they are as she writes their stories. In addition to long- and short-form fiction, she writes poetry and memoir style essays.</p>
            <p>Menke lives on her husband’s family’s dairy farm in Michigan. Here, she homeschools her four children while working towards an MFA in Creative Writing at Southern New Hampshire University.</p> </div>

          <h2>Yackelyn Anillo — Associate Editor</h2>
            <p>Yackelyn Anillo, a passionate, creative writer, was born and raised in the vibrant city of Miami, Florida. In search of a slower-paced lifestyle and inspiration, she made the move to rural North Carolina. With a BA in English from the University of Phoenix, Yackelyn is currently pursuing her MFA in Creative Writing at Southern New Hampshire University.</p>
            <p>When she is not reading, writing, or beta-reading for fellow writers, she is spending quality time with her kids and family. Her love for the fantasy genre runs deep. It was ignited at an early age by the enchanting stories of J.K. Rowling and J.R.R. Tolkien. Today, she is diligently working on her first manuscript within this captivating genre, hoping to bring her dream of becoming a full-time author to life.</p></div>
