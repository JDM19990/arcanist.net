    <p>THE HERETIC'S REFLECTION is composed of two books: <em>What Lies Below</em> and <em>Those Left Behind.</em></p>
    <p>After her husband’s murder and the destruction of her ancestral home, Neryth flees alongside her brother Iason, a grave-tender and war-weary veteran. Though she once rejected her mother’s mystical teachings, fell circumstance tempts her to embrace the very darkness she sought to abandon in order to survive.</p>
    <p>Granted unlikely refuge in a stunning cathedral on the edge of a haunted forest, Neryth and Iason fear they might have fallen deeper into the hands of conspiracy—their sanctuary was arranged by the ever-plotting High Vicar Agustin. Haunted by restless spirits, undead knights, and buried secrets, the siblings find themselves trapped in a paranormal nightmare.</p>
    <p>To protect their home and reclaim their fractured lives, Neryth and Iason must face their grief, set aside old wounds, and stand united against an oppressive church intent on erasing their culture. WHAT LIES BELOW is an intimate gothic fantasy where only the resolute will survive the night.</p>
    <p>Fans of Steven Erikson’s <strong>Malazan Book of the Fallen</strong> and Guy Gavriel Kay’s <strong>The Lions of Al-Rassan</strong> will appreciate Mills’s deep psychological insight and richly grounded worldbuilding. Prepare to be captivated by the gripping opening of <em>The Heretic’s Reflection</em> duology!</p><hr>
<h2 id="-faq-"><strong>FAQ</strong></h2>
    <p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Do I need to read Ashen Rider to understand What Lies Below?</p>
        <p>Ashen Rider was written as a standalone book. While I intended for it to be the preface to my following books, it is not required reading to enjoy What Lies Below. </p>
        <p>Likewise, The Heretic&#39;s Reflection Duology (What Lies Below and Those Left Behind) is written to stand on its own while providing a window to further stories told in the world of Dusk and Dawn. </p>
        <p>This being said, I highly recommend reading Ashen Rider first. It is a short novel, just above novella length and free to read online. </p>
    <hr class="short">
        <p><strong>Question 2:</strong> Will the Dusk and Dawn Books Be Interconnected?</p>
        <p>I&#39;m tired of endless fantasy series. I think a lot of readers are too. The Heretic&#39;s Reflection is the intended start point for my main spread of novels set in the world of Dusk and Dawn, but every book that follows will stand on their own.</p>
        <p>That being said, my books reward reading the entire spread. Those who read the short stories and other books will find nods and easter eggs in unexpected places. I enjoy books that reward rereading while not gatekeeping entry. </p>
    <hr class="short">
        <p><strong>Question 3:</strong> What sets Dusk and Dawn apart from other Fantasy? </p>
        <p>Psychology. While studying writing in college, I elected to minor in psych. I fell in love with the science of the human mind, a passion I share with my late mother. I began writing WLB after she passed away from brain cancer. That experience, watching someone I love wither away so entirely, left a permanent mark on me. </p>
        <p>The lessons I learned through my grief, through rebuilding my life in the aftermath of previously unimaginable pain, are all present in my fantasy—and that begins with WLB. The characters of Dusk and Dawn are people first. They care about their families. They fail. Miserably. They pick themselves back up and try again. </p>
        <p>If you want grounded fantasy that gives a shit about humanity, you&#39;re in the right place. </p>

<h2 id="-for-readers-"><strong>For Readers</strong></h2>
<h3 id="-the-inspirations-behind-ashen-rider-"><strong>The Inspirations Behind Ashen Rider</strong></h3>
    <p>I wear my inspirations on my sleeve. I am also well known for preaching to other writers the importance of balanced inspirations to fantasy. Here are some of mine so you may determine if I&#39;m a hopeless hack or an artist paying homage where its due. </p>
<h4>Pet Sematary by Stephen King:</h4> 
    <p>Probably my favorite story of all time. The macabre tone, the focus on grief and burial, even the aesthetic choices of the 2019 film...all of it has found its way into my work.</p>
<h4>Malazan Book of the Fallen (and the Novels of the Malazan Empire) by Steven Erikson and Ian C. Esslemont:</h4>
    <p>Unabashedly my favorite fantasy of all time. I went to school to write because I wanted to write like these authors. Luckily, I found something I like better...how to write like me.The core component I&#39;ve stolen from Malazan is the breadth of POV, I love narratives that include the perspectives of many different people, especially when you see the same scene play out from different characters&#39; perspectives. </p>
<h4>The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson:</h4> 
    <p>There's a haunted estate in WLB. Blame Shirley.</p>
<h4>The Rosehills Cemetery in Bloomington, Indiana</h4> 
    <p>Indiana is full of graveyards. It's creepy that way. I like it. This graveyard is huge and only a few minute's walk from my house. The history and design within the grounds is fascinating, and I've spent a lot of time there.</p>
<h4>The Righteous Mind by Johnathan Haidt:</h4> 
    <p>I read a lot of nonfiction, especially covering topics of Psychology. I am fascinated by Haidt's explination for why good people can end up on radically different sides of the political spectrum, and how different types of thinkers are moved by different aspects of morality. Haidt's observations about human morality are highly prevalent in my fantasy.</p>
<h4>The Divine Comedy and Paradise Lost:</h4> 
    <p>This will come as no surprise to anyone whose read these iconic works of verse. I&#39;ve stolen much from Dante and Milton (some intentional, some unintentional). At the time of publishing, I&#39;ve yet to complete my dives into these classics, so allow their inclusion here to stand as testament to the extent we&#39;ve absorbed these stories into our collective unconscious (or, our implicit knowledge). </p>
<h4>Dungeons and Dragons and Tabletop Gaming:</h4> 
    <p>The primary narrator&#39;s name is not revealed until nearly the end of the book—this is partially because he is highly relevant to the world of Dusk and Dawn, but mostly because he is highly relevant to a select few people who know him from our gaming days. Further, Ashen Rider began as an adventure module I was writing in 2020. It then became a series of short stories, written and rewritten countless times until I settled on the book you see here. </p>

    <p>The map of Kaldea in the fifth century, as seen in <a href="../novels/hr.html"><em>What Lies Below,</em></a> was illustrated by Eden Louisa, my wonderful wife and creative partner.

### **Map of Pandemonium**

Pandemonium is a strange place. Its layout is primarily inspired by Dante Aligieri's depiction of hell in his *Divine Comedy*, the Infernal Hells featured in the *Forgetten Realms* (Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition), and the game world of *Dark Souls* (2011). Unlike these, however, Pandemonium has both vertical and horizontal hellish layers.
